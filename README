🌤️ Weather App
A simple Node.js command-line tool that allows users to enter a city name and fetches current weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity using the Open-Meteo API. The app includes error handling and logs meaningful output for ease of debugging.

📦 Project Overview
This Weather App takes a city name as input, uses the Open-Meteo Geocoding API to get coordinates, and then fetches real-time weather data. It outputs:

Temperature in Celsius

Weather condition (description based on weather codes)

Wind speed and humidity (if extended)

Installation Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app

Install dependencies:
npm install

Ensure you're using Node.js version 18.4.0 or higher:
node -v

Usage Guide
1. Run the app:
npm start
2. When prompted, enter a city name (e.g., London, Accra, New York).
3. View the weather output in your terminal.

Example Output
Enter a city name: Accra

Weather for Accra:
--------------------
Temperature: 29°C
Condition: Partly cloudy

Features
1. Fetches weather using real-time Open-Meteo data

2. Displays human-readable weather descriptions

Handles:

1. Invalid or misspelled city names

2. API connection issues

3. Unexpected responses

4. Easy-to-understand code structure for beginners

5. Can be extended to support logging to a file (e.g., weather.log)

Future Improvements
1. Display additional metrics: wind speed, humidity

2. Add unit switching (Celsius/Fahrenheit)

3. Store recent queries in a log file

4. Add retry functionality for failed network calls

5. Convert it into a web API or integrate with a frontend
